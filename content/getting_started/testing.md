## Testing using Vagrant

Vagrant makes it possible to run Ansible scripts inside a virtual machine (backed by VirtualBox).

- For the first time setup, please run `vagrant up`
- Then after making changes to the playbooks, roles or inventory, please run `vagrant provision` to apply the changes to the virtual machine
- The deployed ownCloud instance is accessible under http://172.30.1.2/ with user `admin` and password `owncloud`
- The command `vagrant ssh` makes it possible to enter the VM for debugging purposes
