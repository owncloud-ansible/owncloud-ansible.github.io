The main goal of the ownCloud Ansible project is to provide a simple way to set up your ownCloud instance.

In this context, we provide a collection of Ansible roles to configure and manage the required software stack. Even
though we only provide roles for recommended components, role-based modularization allows you to customize individual
components as needed.

The ownCloud Ansible project currently focuses mainly on host-based deployment. If you would like to use Docker,
we provide ready to use [Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/r/owncloud/server).
